# Programming Language Identifier
This repository contains a simple Python script that utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to identify the programming language of a given code snippet. The model used for identification is pretrained on various programming languages.

## Overview
The Hugging Face Transformers library provides an easy way to use pretrained models for natural language processing tasks. In this script, we load a pretrained model specifically designed for programming language identification. Users can input a code snippet, and the script will predict the programming language.
